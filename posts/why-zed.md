# Why Zed

this is the story of me trying to use Zed as my main editor and note down what I like and what I don't like about it.

I tried Zed because my VSCode run of RAM while compiling a rust project,
to be fair this is not a direct vscode problem but is not helped by the fact that it takes a loooooot of RAM to have a chrome instance running.

## what I like

- autosave behaviour (can customize and show blue dot when there are unsaved changes)
- AI assistant integration, can choose your own model and VIM mode actually support (but doesn't render yet markdown)

## what I am missing

- Jupyter support, but is almost there
- seeting the type when inferred in Rust (mainly to quickly navigate to definition)
- the language server could be snappier
- to be hosnte it is actually lagging sometimes, maybe it was a problem with the theme as now I switched to a default one and it is smoooth
