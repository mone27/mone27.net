# FastHTML and this blog

this blog is made using FastHTML, because why not?

FastHTML is very simple to start a website and is a good excuse to learn something new.
Moreover in the future I can always add interactivity if I want to, but still serve simple HTML pages.

## Why FastHTML?

well the simplicity and the speed of development are just amazing!
I can't recall the last time where I had so much fun developing a website!
I mean I can write components in a Jupyter notebook, test them and play with them interactively and then I have a website!
